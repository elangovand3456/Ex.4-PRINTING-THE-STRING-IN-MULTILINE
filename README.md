# Ex.4-PRINTING-THE-STRING-IN-MULTILINE
### AIM
To create a python program to print the string in multiline using triple quotes.
### ALGORITHM

Step 1:	 Begin the program.
Step 2:	 Use triple quotes (''' or """) to define a string that spans multiple lines.
Step 3:	 Use the print() function to display the multi-line string.
Step 4:	 Terminate the program.
### PROGRAM
string_single_quotes = '''I am a string literal
... has more than one
... line
....placed inside triple single quotes'''


string_double_quotes = """I am a string literal
... has more than one
... line
....placed inside triple double quotes"""


print(string_single_quotes)
print(string_double_quotes)
